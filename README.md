# SHIFT-SPEC-001
Installation Tolerances for Underground Belt Conveyors and Structures.

## Scope

This normative specification details the tolerancing requirements for underground conveyor systems.

## Definitions
1. Dead Load:  the intrinsic weight of a structure or vehicle, excluding the weight of passengers or goods.

##Introduction

Installation tolerancing of conveyor idlers is critical for the correct support of the run-off length conveyor. This belt support allows for the optimization of conveyor idler life and reduction of tracking and training challenges of belting on site.

###Idler Supporting Support

> Idler support structure mounting holes to have  ± 5.0 mm tolerance longitudinally and ± 2.0 mm tolerance in the lateral direction ( Plan view )

> The installed idler stringers shall be limited to lateral centreline dimensional tolerancing of ± 3.0 mm on a 3m length , this should be limited to 25.0 mm over the length of that stringer.
