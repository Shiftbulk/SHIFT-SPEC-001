# SHIFT-SPEC-001
Installation Tolerances for Underground Belt Conveyors and Structures.

## Scope

This normative specification details the tolerancing requirements for underground conveyor systems.

## Definitions
1. Dead Load:  the intrinsic weight of a structure or vehicle, excluding the weight of passengers or goods.

##Introduction

Installation tolerancing of conveyor idlers is critical for the correct support of the run-off length conveyor. This belt support allows for the optimization of conveyor idler life and reduction of tracking and training challenges of belting on site.

###Idler Supporting Support

> Idler support structure mounting holes to have  ± 5.0 mm tolerance longitudinally and ± 2.0 mm tolerance in the lateral direction ( Plan view )


![Figure 2](/Stringer.PNG)
> The installed idler stringers shall be limited to lateral centreline dimensional tolerancing of ± 3.0 mm on a 3m length , this should be limited to 25.0 mm over the length of that stringer.

> Vertical misalignment of stringers should be limited to 3mm over the length of the stringer

![Figure 4](/vertical%20front%20view.PNG)
> Looking at the Idler in front view, installation tolerances for the vertical misalignment should be limited to the width of the stringers / 600 for suspended idlers and width / 300 for fixed form.
