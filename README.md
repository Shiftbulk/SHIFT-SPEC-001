# SHIFT-SPEC-001
Installation Tolerances for Underground Belt Conveyors and Structures.

## Scope

This normative specification details the tolerancing requirements for underground conveyor systems.

## Definitions
1. Dead Load:  the intrinsic weight of a structure or vehicle, excluding the weight of passengers or goods.

##Introduction

Installation tolerancing of conveyor idlers is critical for the correct support of the run-off length conveyor. This belt support allows for the optimization of conveyor idler life and reduction of tracking and training challenges of belting on site.
